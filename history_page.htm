								<p>In the first half of the 18th Century cricket established itself as a leading sport in London and the south-eastern counties
								of England. Its spread was limited by the constraints of travel, but it was slowly gaining popularity in other parts of England and Women’s Cricket 
								dates back to the 1745, when the first known match was played in Surrey.

								In 1744, the first Laws of Cricket were written and subsequently amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, a 3rd stump, - 
								the middle stump and a maximum bat width were added. The codes were drawn up by the “Star and Garter Club” whose members ultimately 
								founded the famous Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made revisions 
								ever since then to the current day.</p>
